# Weather


Homework 6 was probably the hardest assignment thatI feel I have done. The point was to make a Weather Dashboard that gives you the actual time weather as well as a 5 day forecast for the dame city that you search. Using API calls from OpenWeather API was the call that was used to get the weather. Every time you search for a city it is suppose to stay saved on to the local storage of the HTML.
